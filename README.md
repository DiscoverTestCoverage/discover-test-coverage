[![build](https://github.com/DiscoverTestCoverage/discover-test-coverage/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DiscoverTestCoverage/discover-test-coverage/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This repository provides the `discover` command that allows you to:

- Instrument a subject application to collect discover test coverage through
  disabling code segments
- Run the test suite of a subject application to:
  - Execute the test suite and report its status
  - Collect standard coverage information
  - Collect fortified coverage information

This project is in early stages and thus the documentation and implementation
are emerging.
