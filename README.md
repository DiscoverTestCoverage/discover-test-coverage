# fortify-coverage-cli

This repository provides the `fortify` command that allows you to:

- Instrument a subject application to collect fortified coverage
- Run the test suite of a subject application to:
  - Execute the test suite and report its status
  - Collect standard coverage information
  - Collect fortified coverage information

This project is in early stages and thus the documentation and implementation are emerging.
